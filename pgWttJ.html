						<h2>A Parent’s Guide to Welcome to the Jungle</h2>
						<p>Insight into the comic</p>
					</header>
					<section>
						<header>
							<h3 id="age">AGE RANGE</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							This illustrated cartoon was created with young children aged 5-8 in mind. If your child is
							on the younger end of this spectrum, they may require your help reading longer, more
							complicated sentences. Advanced readers with levels upwards of a 1st grade reading level
							should have no trouble comprehending this cartoon and answering questions about it.
						</p>

							<h3 id="story">WHAT’S THE STORY?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Welcome to the Jungle begins with an introduction from the story’s narrator, a safari guide
							named Franklin. Franklin begins by discussing the different possibilities for both fun and
							danger online, and metaphorically relates jungle predators such as a lion and a snake to
							much more real online predators. Franklin leads readers through a “safari,” in which they
							encounter both friendly and dangerous internet characters. The friendly characters, such as
							Pablo the Parrot, are designed to instill a sense of trust between parents and children
							regarding topics witnessed online. The predatory characters like Leo the Lion play the role
							of the most common deceptive ploys young children fall into online. There are also two
							‘choose your own adventure’ style questions, in which your reader will choose between a safe
							and a risky online behavior. Both selections are followed up with brief explanations of what
							the proper solution was. The story concludes with brief messages from each friendly jungle
							character with the most important take-aways from their portion of the cartoon. This story
							is lighthearted and bright, but contains important metaphors that are designed to foster
							conversations with your child about internet behavior.

							<h3 id="topics">TOPICS DISCUSSED/IMPLIED</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							<b>Assumed Trust:</b> Franklin, the safari guide, is immediately trusted by young readers
							since he introduces the story and is the narrator. While this acceptance of Franklin is
							okay, it still introduces the important question of trusting authority figures. Your child
							has likely been taught to trust uniformed people in real life, but the line between false
							and true authority is blurred online and it is easy for predators to claim a fake position
							in order to gain the trust of your child.<br><br>
							<b>Parental Discussions:</b> Pablo the Parrot Parent plays the role of a friendly jungle
							animal who reminds readers to immediately turn to a trusted adult if they see or hear
							anything online that makes them uncomfortable. <br><br>
							<b>Unwelcomed Pictures:</b> In the cartoon, a predatory snake “sends pictures of things that
							make you uncomfortable.” This statement could include anything from drugs to pornographic
							material. Your child is likely not ready for an in-depth discussion about the nature of
							these inappropriate things, so you should simply reiterate that you are always open to a
							discussion about anything they encounter online.<br><br>
							<b>Cyberbullying:</b> The cartoon depicts a scene of cyberbullying in which your reader is
							asked to choose between standing up for the bullied character or joining the online
							harassment<br><br>
							<b>Information Sharing:</b> A predatory character in the story offers to send a present if
							the safari explorer offers their address and does not tell their parents. This is possibly
							the most important subject discussed in Welcome to the Jungle, and it should be followed up
							with an in-depth discussion about appropriate versus inappropriate things to share
							online.<br><br>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/stanpic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								This is a website with materials put together by a team of Stanford undergrads, a
								Stanford grad student, and some high school students in program called STEM to SHTEM.
								This was all a collobarative effort with the purpose to educate many about information
								scienes and how it pops up in the most common ways such as in social media.
								We as a result also wanted to teach information safety and how to use certain social
								media sites for those who also need help with them.
