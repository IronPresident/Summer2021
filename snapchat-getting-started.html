									<h2>Get Started with Snapchat</h2>
									<p>Some usefull tips and tricks as well as how to download</p>
								</header>
								</p>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3 id="definitions">Snapchat features definitions:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										<b>Snap:</b> It is a maximum 10 second video or a picture that 
										is taken using the app that can be seen by your friends or on your 
										snap story. Snaps are deleted every 24 hours or depending on when your 
										friends have seen your video. Any snaps that are not opened/seen will 
										automatically deleted after 30 days of it being sent. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Stories:</b> Stories is where you will be able to locate your snap 
										(pictures/videos) for your snap friends to view. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Custom Stories:</b> In this part of Snapchat, you and your snap friends 
										are able to send snaps to one another. In this case you would create a “Group Story”. 
										Instead of all your snaps friends in one story, you can separate your views and add 
										them into a group story where you all are able to send one another your timeline.
										<br><br>
										<b>Snap Streak:</b> If you and your friend send a snap to another on a continuous path 
										for a constant 24 hours for three days straight then you and your friend have a streak. 
										Snapchat will continuously keep track of your streak. By looking on the right side of your 
										friends name you will see a flame emoji and a number, which represents the amount of days 
										you and your friend have had your streak.  Remember that your chats are not counted towards 
										your streaks, only snap pictures/videos. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Filters:</b> Snap filters are exceptional backgrounds that allow you to add fun effects 
										towards your snaps. Filters, also, come in stickers that you can add onto the background. 
										You have several different filters to choose from. Filters do add and change depending on 
										time, day, holidays, seasons, etc. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Snapchat lens:</b> These are very similar to filters except these lens allow you to 
										animate your snaps. To contrast from filters these must be used while you are filming/ taking 
										your snap. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Geofilter:</b> Geofilter are filters that are based on your location/time. This must be enabled 
										within your snap settings in order to retrieve them. To add your own uniqueness, you can personalized 
										your own geofilter for approxaimly $5.99.
										<br><br>
										<b>Snapcode:</b> Snapcodes are QR codes where you or your friends can scan so that you can add your 
										friends rather than access their account username. Every individual on Snapchat has a QR code; you 
										are automatically assigned to once. You can, also, create your own snap code for business highlights 
										or to showcase websites. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Chat:</b> The Chat section of Snap is where you can access any messages or individual/group snap 
										and messages. Remember that snaps are deleted once you view them. Pictures and videos that are coming 
										directly from your phone photos can be saved in the chat section, as well as, chats. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Memories:</b> The memories feature allows you to save your story posts for your personal views only. 
										Snap keeps your memories in a camera roll trait. You can always re-post your older stories that are 
										saved into your memories. Remember that you would need to manually sav your memories, it does not save 
										into memories automatically. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Friends Page:</b> Based on Snapchats algorithms, once you swipe left of the camera page, you will 
										be able to see your friends list.
										<br><br>
										<b>Discover Page:</b> This is based on Snapchat’s algorithms. This is the section where you can subscribe 
										or follow content creators, influencers, celebrities, publishers, etc. you will also be able to find your 
										subscribed channels as well.
										<br><br>
										<b>Snap Map:</b> The Snapmap shows you and your friends location and time of place on a map. You need to 
										enable your location in the Snapchat setting in order for this to work or place yourself on “ghost mode”, 
										which means to not be placed onto the map. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Bitmoji:</b> Bitmoji is a cartoon version of yourself that acts as your profile picture. You can 
										personalize your cartoon as your own convenience. In order to have a Bitmoji you must download Bitmoji and 
										connect it with your snapchat account or by simply using your SnapCode to connect the two apps.

									<h2>What's this all about?</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/stanpic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									This is a website with materials put together by a team of Stanford undergrads, a Stanford grad student, and some high school students in program called STEM to SHTEM.
									This was all a collobarative effort with the purpose to educate many about information scienes and how it pops up in the most common ways such as in social media.
									We as a result also wanted to teach information safety and how to use certain social media sites for those who also need help with them.
